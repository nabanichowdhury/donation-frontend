# Donation Website

This is a website where helpless people can ask for help in any case they need. After admin approval, a donation post is made by the admin, and users who want to donate can do so for that donation post. Essentially, users facilitate the donation process.

Users have a user dashboard where they can see their respective donation progress and statistics. The admin can approve valid donation requests, and the person who requested the donation will receive an email as their request will proceed further. Users who want to donate can create accounts and donate according to the post.

An admin can add other admins, create donation posts, approve or deny donation requests, and view donated statistics.
